### Constructor and Prototype Practice

This assign was practice on how to create Constructor and Prototypes and how to use them. We were assigned to make 3 `Dog()` and 2 `Human()` Constructors. We needed to be able to pass the test that were in the `test.js` file by opening up `index.html` in a browser and open up the console and try to pass all the test.
